# Abyss Framework

Welcome to Abyss, a modern, lightweight PHP framework designed to give developers full control over their applications. Inspired by the philosophy of empowering developers to build powerful and efficient software with simplicity and elegance, Abyss combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of traditional PHP development and the sophistication of modern frameworks.

## Why Abyss?

Abyss is more than just a framework—it's a philosophy. At OpenVoid, we believe in providing developers with tools that do not constrain their creativity but rather enhance it. Abyss is built with a focus on:

- **Simplicity**: A clean and intuitive API that doesn't get in the way of your code.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring your applications run smoothly.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable with custom libraries and components to suit your project's needs.
- **Modern Practices**: Incorporating best practices in security, routing, and state management, without compromising flexibility.
- **Empowerment**: Our goal is to empower developers to create, innovate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

## To-Do List

   - Create a templating engine inspired by Blade, integrated with a reactive component system similar to Livewire.

6. **Integrate All Components and Build Core Framework**
   - Integrate the routing, authentication, ORM, and templating components into a cohesive framework.

7. **Write Documentation**
   - Develop comprehensive documentation, including a user guide, API reference, and examples.

8. **Testing and Optimization**
